Its also not news that insecurity and high inflation rates are now the norm in the country, making it difficult \u00a0for the average and less than average Nigerian to acquire commodities ranging from agricultural products to electronics and other things of value.<\/p>\n<p>The covid-19 pandemic has not helped the situation in any way as so many businesses had to close down as a result of the lock-down imposed on all countries of the world to avoid the spread of the disease. Although businesses have resumed, many still face setbacks brought about by the pandemic. Many businesses are facing a hard time in meeting recurrent expenditures as they are not meeting up with sales which has drastically reduced their revenues.<\/p>\n<p>These and more has led to the rediscovery of bartering as a better way to cope with the hardship being faced by everyone in the country and I bet you it has come to stay.<\/p>\n<p>The primary reason for setting up an online social bartering network is offer a solution to our current economic woes a as nation. Although we are only on the online space we hope to create a brick and mortar store to get across to yet even a larger population who do not have access to the internet but want to be a part of the system.<\/p>\n<p>Bartering is not just for individuals who are looking to get one item or the other through our system but very sustainable for businesses as it has been proven that participating organizations can now increase their visibility and yearly business by approximately 10% to 15% through swapping their services for the services of other businesses. According to Ron Whitney, president of the US-based International Reciprocal Trade Association, a non- profit organization; says that member organizations and individuals can trade goods and professional services for barter credits that can be used buy services or goods and services of another member.<\/p>\n<p>For example a caterer would do a \u20a65,000 birthday cake for a nurse. That does not mean she has traded her labour for \u20a65,000 of medical services; rather she has an account with the barter exchange more like a credit card which is credited with 5000 trade naira and can be spent on any of the members in that exchange.\u00a0 &#8220;Bartering to me brings about swapping items in a more communal and gentler way without money changing hands thus displaying some bits of community spirit and solidarity among average and less than average citizens of the country.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We are currently on the publicity stage and hope to build a strong and reliable community of bartering traders who though might not have the purchasing power for certain item but can barter what they have for what they want be a service or item for another service or item. Thus I am glad to tell that this network is here to stay. It has never being better without bartering it!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the devaluing of the naira currency and a serious backdrop on oil prices in the international oil market, Nigeria is facing serious economic crises which has led to the depression and recession we are currently facing as a nation.

If you do not, we have a few tips to ensure that your negotiations are successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Keep it cordial<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Be pleasant and polite throughout the negotiation.

A good way to do this is to\u00a0 ask what they want and also what their hobbies and interests are. This increases your chances of finding out where your interests intersect.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Talk up your item<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When you have figured out what the trade owner wants, if you have an item that satisfies this want, you need to talk it up. Please do not lie about the condition of the item rather talk about its unique history. That may be the way it was acquired or what it has been used for.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Shipping<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Depending on the items being traded, there may be particular shipping requirements.

For many of us, this happened as children when we would swap our toys or snacks with friends because we had limited financial resources. Just like us, human society in its adolescence developed barter as a means of facilitating transactions. Today, the barter system still exists and with the level of technology and innovation in online markets, it is gradually making a comeback.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the reasons that barter lost favour is that it was heavily dependent on the market size. In human history, it could only occur between people in the same geographical area because of the difficulties in spreading information quickly and over a large area. With the internet, however, information can be shared almost anywhere and everywhere in the world at the same time. The whole world is the market and all the goods and services in it are available to trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bartering does not involve money and in today\u2019s economy characterised by rapidly rising prices, the importance of saving on our cash expenditure wherever possible has never been more prevailing. For example, during the great depression when there was a lack of money in the economy, barter was used to exchange goods for food. More recently, during the covid pandemic when households were similarly cash-strapped, it was only through barter systems that some households were able to get by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The barter system has a long history and it is indelibly linked to human commerce. Nevertheless, it has its flaws which have led to it being replaced by the monetary system. For a market to effectively utilize the barter system, it must first identify these problems and then ideate the solutions to those problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commonly cited problem with the practice of barter is the lack of a common measure of value. There is no system with which items that appear on the market can be assigned a unique value. Rather, each transaction is left to create their own rate of exchange. This means that there are as many exchange rate systems as there are individual market transactions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some consider this a detriment, at Fairtrade, we capitalise on this unique feature to provide you with full control the value of your goods and services. Fairtrade is built on the idea that one man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure. This means that two people may trade things that are useless to them for things that are of immense value to one another. This system of transaction ensures that both parties are winners in any transaction as opposed to the monetary system where you either lose your possession or money. With Fairtrade, you always stand to gain something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another advantage to using Fairtrade is that there are no limits to what can be traded. From items to services, chances are, if you have it, someone else wants it.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At some point in our lives, we have engaged in some form of barter.
