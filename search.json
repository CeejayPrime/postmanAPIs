Its also not news that insecurity and high inflation rates are now the norm in the country, making it difficult \u00a0for the average and less than average Nigerian to acquire commodities ranging from agricultural products to electronics and other things of value.<\/p>\n<p>The covid-19 pandemic has not helped the situation in any way as so many businesses had to close down as a result of the lock-down imposed on all countries of the world to avoid the spread of the disease. Although businesses have resumed, many still face setbacks brought about by the pandemic. Many businesses are facing a hard time in meeting recurrent expenditures as they are not meeting up with sales which has drastically reduced their revenues.<\/p>\n<p>These and more has led to the rediscovery of bartering as a better way to cope with the hardship being faced by everyone in the country and I bet you it has come to stay.<\/p>\n<p>The primary reason for setting up an online social bartering network is offer a solution to our current economic woes a as nation. Although we are only on the online space we hope to create a brick and mortar store to get across to yet even a larger population who do not have access to the internet but want to be a part of the system.<\/p>\n<p>Bartering is not just for individuals who are looking to get one item or the other through our system but very sustainable for businesses as it has been proven that participating organizations can now increase their visibility and yearly business by approximately 10% to 15% through swapping their services for the services of other businesses. According to Ron Whitney, president of the US-based International Reciprocal Trade Association, a non- profit organization; says that member organizations and individuals can trade goods and professional services for barter credits that can be used buy services or goods and services of another member.<\/p>\n<p>For example a caterer would do a \u20a65,000 birthday cake for a nurse. That does not mean she has traded her labour for \u20a65,000 of medical services; rather she has an account with the barter exchange more like a credit card which is credited with 5000 trade naira and can be spent on any of the members in that exchange.\u00a0 &#8220;Bartering to me brings about swapping items in a more communal and gentler way without money changing hands thus displaying some bits of community spirit and solidarity among average and less than average citizens of the country.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We are currently on the publicity stage and hope to build a strong and reliable community of bartering traders who though might not have the purchasing power for certain item but can barter what they have for what they want be a service or item for another service or item. Thus I am glad to tell that this network is here to stay. It has never being better without bartering it!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the devaluing of the naira currency and a serious backdrop on oil prices in the international oil market, Nigeria is facing serious economic crises which has led to the depression and recession we are currently facing as a nation.
